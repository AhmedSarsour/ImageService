# ImageService -- Project -- Advanced Programming 2.
this project is divided into 4 parts:
1) Android application, by connecting to the same wifi as your PC, and by clicking a button on the android application, all your images are transferred to your PC.
2) a Desktop application that monitors certain folders (handlers) on your PC, takes the transferred images from and moves them to a HIDDEN folder and sorts the images by year & month and also creates a thumbnails for the images in that hidden folder.
3) a GUI application in which shows the monitoring system LOG, and shows the list of the folder_handlers, you can add and remove handlers by the GUI application.
4) a WEB application in which takes the images in the hidden folder, and displays them in a good view. Also this web app displays information about the user and some information about the file handlers.

All of the parts above come together to be called an "image service", as it services the phone's image in an amazing way.
